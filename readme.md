# QuickPic

Simple JavaScript web app that shows you random images with a 30 second timer so you can practice sketching. Inspired by Quickposes.

Created for Codedex.io JS course final project.

## To do
- Address problem where the timer starts counting down while the new image is still loading, so that you don't actually get the full 30 seconds to draw
- Add sound when timer finishes
- Make it possible to change the timer length (preset choices, or enter your own number?)
- Improve the text styling 
- Make button/timer float on the side or something so that it remains on screen alongside image on short wide screens?
- Give the circle a visual countdown ring that shrinks with the time remaining
- Use Unsplash or similar (higher quality photos) instead of Picsum
- Add an option to quit current session and refresh the image early
- Allow user to enter a search term instead of image being completely random
