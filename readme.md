# QuickPic

Simple JavaScript web app that shows you random images with a 30 second timer so you can practice sketching. Inspired by Quickposes.

Created for Codedex.io JS course final project.

## To do
- Address problem where the timer starts counting down while the new image is still loading, so that you don't actually get the full 30 seconds to draw
- Add sound when timer finishes
- Make it possible to change the timer length (preset choices, or enter your own number?)
- Improve the text styling 
- Use Unsplash instead of Picsum
- Make the sizes of image, button, and text within button responsive
